/**
 * Per-session inference config — the model, mode, thinking effort, and context
 * budget a single session runs with.
 *
 * The rule, in one line: **a session owns its config; the global settings are
 * only the template new sessions are stamped from.**
 *
 * Every session (a `chats` row) carries its own provider/model/agent/effort/
 * context columns, seeded from `AppSettings` at create time. Changing a picker
 * writes BOTH the open session's row and the global default, so:
 *
 *   - switching model in session A never touches session B, and
 *   - the NEXT new session starts from whatever you last chose.
 *
 * Seeding is a snapshot, deliberately: editing a picker later must not
 * retroactively rewrite sessions you already tuned. Sessions created before this
 * existed have NULL columns and fall back to the globals here, so upgrading
 * changes nothing until you touch a picker.
 *
 * This module is the SINGLE resolver. Three call sites used to duplicate this
 * logic (the renderer's send path, its compaction path, and the main process's
 * phone-driven turn) and drifted; they all route through `resolveSessionConfig`
 * now so they cannot disagree about which model a session is on.
 *
 * Isomorphic: types and pure functions only, no Node/Electron/browser imports.
