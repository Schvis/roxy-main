/**
 * Registry of tool calls that are executing RIGHT NOW, so one of them can be
 * cancelled on its own.
 *
 * Stop was all-or-nothing before this. A turn that fired `bash npm test` on a
 * wedged suite, or a `webfetch` at a host that never answers, left exactly one
 * lever: kill the entire turn — throwing away the model's reasoning and every
 * other tool result alongside the one call you actually wanted gone. This is the
 * missing granularity, and it's deliberately the same shape as the subagent
 * registry next door (`subagent-stream.ts`): a map from a public id to a
 * `cancel`, an explicit `cancelled` flag so the harness can tell "the user did
 * this" from "it failed", and a handle-based API so a finished run can't be
 * resurrected by a late call.
 *
 * Keyed by the model's tool-call id, which is the id a tool card already carries
 * to the renderer and the only one that names a single call inside a turn.
 *
 * Not persisted and not broadcast: unlike a subagent run, a tool call cannot
 * outlive the turn that started it, so the requestId-keyed `llm:delta` stream
 * the card already rides is enough to reflect the outcome. The renderer only
 * ever needs to ASK (an invoke), never to be told out-of-band.
